# Genetic Algorithm for Knapsack Problem

Overview:
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem. The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to select a subset of items to maximize the total utility while respecting a constraint on the total weight (the capacity of the knapsack).
